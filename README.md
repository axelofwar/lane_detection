# lane_detection_tyler
catkin_ws with code and markdown files for lane detection scripts. lane_detect = static &amp; lane_find = dynamic

lane_detection_ws.zip is the zip file including all output files as well as calibration files. Included individually are the pertinent files for lane detection.

The path planning and localization algorithms that I contributed to are proprietary to the UDM IGVC group, and thus are not included. 

The outdated_IP_code is written in tandem with Philip Renn and Dr. Mark Paulik
